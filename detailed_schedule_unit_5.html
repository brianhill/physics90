<!-- 

Monday, May 13th
3. Hubble's 1925 paper applying Leavitt's Cepheid method to nearby galaxies (M31 and M33)
================
Wednesday, May 15th
5. Doppler Shift
6. Hubble's 1929 Paper and the Hubble Plot
================
Friday, May 17th
7. Confirmation of Big Bang -- the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
8. High-z Redshifts
9. Dark Matter (but I did NOT have time to do Dark Energy, which is a 2nd type of dark matter, requires general relativity to really understand)
10. Galactic Rotation Curves -- what was expected if all the mass is in the center? -- what is seen? -- this was rushed -- I can only ask the very basics
