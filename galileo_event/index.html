	<h3>Galileo&rsquo;s Lunar Observations</h3>

We will understand his observations and recreate his estimates of the Moon&rsquo;s highest peaks. Participants should print out or have handy on a computer this Worksheet: <a href="./mountains_on_the_moon.pdf">Galileo's Lunar Observations: Measuring the Mountains on the Moon</a>.</p>
