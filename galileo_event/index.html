	<h3>Galileo&rsquo;s Lunar Observations</h3>

	<p>In <em>The Starry Messenger,</em> Galileo describes the Moon with the wonder of someone seeing its details for the first time in history. We will understand his observations and recreate his estimates of the Moon&rsquo;s highest peaks. Participants should print out or have handy on a computer this PDF: <a href="./mountains_on_the_moon.pdf">Mountains on the Moon</a>.</p>
