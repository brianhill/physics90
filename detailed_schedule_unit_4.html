1. Introduced the parallax method.
2. The parallax formula can be defined using either the tangent of the angle (opposite / adjacent) or the pie crust formula.
3. The base of the triangle or the amount of pie crust is 1 A.U.
4. The parallax angle is defined as half of the angle that the star moves as it goes from one extreme to another.
5. The parallax angle is usually measured in arcseconds (know how degrees are divided into arcminutes and arcminutes are divided into arcseconds)
6. The parsec is short for the distance associated with a parallax angle of one arcsecond.
7. The parsec uses angles but it is *not* a measurement of angle. It is a measurement of distance.
8. The pie crust formula tells you that the distance to a star is *inversely* proportional to its parallax angle.
9. The nearest star has a parallax angle of a little less than one arcsecond.
10. The light-year is how far light goes in one year. It is 3.0 * 10**8 m/s * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 1 year.
11. If you carefully cancel the units, you'll see that comes out in meters. The light-year uses time, but is is *not* a measurement of time. It is a measurement of distance.
Note: Perhaps it helps study to compare/contrast 7 with 11.
12. Introduced absolute magnitude. The absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude a star would have *if* it were at a 
standard distance. The standard distance is chosen to be 10 parsecs.
13. Needed to review the magnitude system from Unit 1. Now that we have two kinds of magnitudes, that older kind of magnitude is now going to be called "apparent magnitude" to distinguish it from "absolute magnitude."
14. Also reviewed luminosity (L, the power output of a star in Watts) and the intensity formula, I = L / (4 pi R^2).
Note: We have exhausted our ability to compute distances using angles. The angles are just too small for things more than a few thousand parsecs away.
15. Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (abbreviation "HR diagram"). Know what is plotted.
15a. Horizontal axis is the temperature of the star, with the hottest (bluish) stars on the left and the coolest (reddish) stars on the right.
15b. Vertical axis is either luminosity or absolute magnitude. These are different measures of the same thing. Often one scale is on the left vertical axis and the other scale is on the right vertical axis.
15c. Know the three major groupings on the HR diagram (main sequence, red giants, white dwarfs).
==== to here before Aaron's lecture ===-
=== he did birth of stars ===
=== then I did death of stars ===
16. Leavitt-Pickering Period-Luminosity Relationship. Know what they plotted.
16a. Horizontal axis is the period of the pulsation (like a bike blinky) in days.
16b. Vertical axis is the apparent magnitude.
17. Know what Leavitt was studying (pictures from observatories all over the world were sent to Harvard -- she focused on variable stars in the Large and Small Magellanic clouds)
18. For both the HR diagram and the Leavitt-Pickering diagram, we have classifications of stars that tell us a star's magnitude. The most major difference is that:
18a. For the HR diagram the classification is by color
18b. For the period-luminosity relationship, the classification is by period and the brightness has both a maximum and a minimum.
From either the HR diagram or the period-luminisoty diagram, we use one of two formulas (equivalent):
19a. 2.5^(m-M)=R^2/(10 parsec)^2 <==== equivalent to the next one but less exact
19b. 100^((m-M)/5)=R^2/(10 parsec)^2
20. I did a nasty example on the whiteboard where I solved for M and I needed the logarithm. You only need to know how to solve the formulas in 19a and 19b for R, which just means taking the square root of both sides, and then multiplying through by 10 parsec.

The big picture is that this unit we came to the limit of discovering how far away things are using geometry (parallax method angles get too small to measure). The new method that you now have is to figure out how far away things are if we know their apparent magnitude and their absolute magnitude. Hertzsprung-Russell and Leavitt-Pickering give us two ways to identify stars of a given type, and that is how we are going to get to the galaxies. We have already gotten as far as the Magellanic clouds, which are mini-galaxies orbiting our galaxy.
